# R_Repository
The R code present in this branch aims to help with analyzing data on the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file, provided by Hospital Compare. The functions were written by me, however the idea of these functions comes from an online course on Coursera, provided by Roger D. Peng and the Johns Hopkins University. The course is about learning R programming.
